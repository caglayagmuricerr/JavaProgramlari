# StudentAttendanceTracker
The "Student Attendance Tracker" project is a Java application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for tracking and managing student information. Users can interact with the interface by clicking a button to add absence days for the selected student, triggering real-time updates to the displayed information. I made this small project to practice OOP principles like Inheritance, Abstraction etc. in JAVA.
